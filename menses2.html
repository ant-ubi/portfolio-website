                  <h3>Goal</h3>
                  <p>
                    The goal with Menses was to create a responsive iOS and Android app that could successfully track your period and ovulation cycle. I wanted the app to follow the brief by being able to solve a specific user problem. In this case it would be an app helping to provide women with information about their sexual and reproductive health in conjunction with proving a tracking tool for their cycle needs.

                <ol>
                    <li>Research: I analysed competitor apps and conducted user research to gain an insight of tracking apps and what features would need to be included for key functionality.</li>
                    <li>UX Design: I created a user flow based on user interactions and implemented iOS or Android features (dependant on OS) into low, mid and high-fidelity wireframes.</li>
                    <li>UI Design: I focussed on designing screens that were clear; translating the purpose for use well.</li>

                    I began my process by conducting a UX analysis on two popular tracking apps Clue, and Flo. This allowed me to gain an initial idea of what the apps strengths and weaknesses were along with what may have been lacking in terms of functionality and inclusive features.  This also aided me on how to approach designing this app.

                    <h3>My Findings</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Both apps not only tracked cycles but also implemented articles and a mood/energy tracker.</li>
                        <li>There are features where users can input calendar entries for the start and end of their period along with having tips and tricks on how to manage PMS.</li>
                        <li>Both had features which allowed users to browse thousands of articles focussing mainly on women’s health.</li>
                        <li>Both had a organized clean layout with fun colours to keep the user engaged and focussed.</li>

                    With now having an understanding on the various features that would be involved with this design, along with the user personas in mind, I was then able to create a user flow.

                    <p>
                    Assessing the key Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) I mapped out the key processes and the tasks that would be completed on the Menses App.
                    </p>
                    <h3>JTBD</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I want a sign-up process that has an extra security measure so that I know my personal information is protected.</li>
                        <li>I want to be able to write reviews on different types of birth controls so that I may share my experience with other women.</li>
                        <li>I want a straightforward login process that will take me straight to the homepage so that I can view my new daily positive affirmation.</li>

                    <p class="project-card__description">
                    I determined to create user personas based on my initial user research. This in turn helped me hone a user-centric design.                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The user personas were primarily based on the potential users of the app, reflecting their needs, wants and interests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    By using scenarios and reflecting on how both personas would approach this app really allowed me to view this app from different perspectives. Thus, when it came to the design process, I referred to these personas constantly.
